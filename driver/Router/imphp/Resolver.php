/**
 * A simple resolver class for the Router
 *
 * Loads controllers based on array keys with IMPHP settings.
 * The settigs index "ROUTER" should contain an array where
 * keys are to match the request string and the value contains the full
 * class name of the controller.
 *
 * Keys may contain regexp, or use shortcuts:
 *
 *      * :num:     - The segment may contain numbers
 *      * :alpha:     - The segment may contain alphanumeric (A-Za-z 0-9 _ and -)
 *      * :all:     - The segment may contain anything
 *
 * The values may also contain redirects.
 *
 *      * ':/new/request'       - Will reset the search and begin searhing for a key matching '/new/request'
 *
 * RegExp matches can also be added to redirects
 *
 *      * '/some/request/(:num)' => ':/new/request/$1'
 *
 * Once a controller is loaded, it is up to it's constructer to decide what's next
 *
 * Note that if called from inside a Controller scope, the request will be set as
 * pending and only executed when the scope is done. Every call while pending,
 * will overwrite the pending request.
