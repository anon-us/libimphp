/**
 * Import CSS and JS files
 *
 * _Note that this depends on you using the Router library for page loads_
 *
 * When you devide content into smaller sections of files, it can be tricky to keep
 * track of which files has been set to be included. Some content files may depends
 * on the same files as other content files being included, which can result
 * in the same file being included multiple times.
 *
 * You may also include two content files where one depends on an additional file
 * that needs to be included in between two files being included by the other content file.
 *
 * This class can help keep track of all this. It contains a regular `import` method
 * that will make sure that files are included only ones. It also contains a `stack` method
 * allowing you to define multiple files in a specific order. The method will make sure that this
 * order is followed, even if some of these files are already being included. The `stack` method can
 * also be pre-defined using the `group` method. This method uses stacks defined in IMPHP's settings
 * allowing you to include specific pr-defined stacks based on a group name.
 *
 * To add stacks to the settings, add an array with index `FILE_IMPORT` to your settings file.
 * This array is single-level using group/stack name as key with an indexed array as value specifying each
 * JS and CSS file within this particular group/stack.
 *
 * All files that are parsed to this class must be relative or absolute server paths.
 * Do not parse files via `Path::fileLink` as this will break the checks and your files
 * will end up being included multiple times. File links are handled automatically during inclusion.
