## libimphp

The IMPHP project is just a raw module loader with a few collection classes. The purpose was to keep it as simple and small as possible, but it would be nice with some addition libraries to work with. This project provides a module for IMPHP that implements a lot of the missing pieces, such as `Encryption`, `Database`, `Session`, `Cookies`, `Router` and many more features.


## Installation

1. The root content of this library should be placed with `data/module/libimphp` of your IMPHP installation.
2. Add `"MODULE" => ["libimphp"]` to your IMPHP `settings.php` file.
3. Create `data/page`. This is where all router pages are loaded from _(Read the documentation)_.
